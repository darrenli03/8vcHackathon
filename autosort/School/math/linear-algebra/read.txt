This directory contains Python files related to linear algebra, specifically a function named `find_null_space` that calculates the null space of a given matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from the SciPy library. The function is well-structured and includes input validation and mathematical operations. Its likely purpose is to assist in understanding linear transformations and their properties. This content relates to each other as they are all part of the same Python script, and they focus on a specific aspect of linear algebra: null space computation. The subject matter pertains to mathematics, specifically linear algebra.
