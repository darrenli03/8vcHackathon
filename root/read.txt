Here's the updated description:

./
A centralized repository for educational resources is contained within this directory. It primarily focuses on subjects commonly taught in schools, including English language and literature, mathematics (linear algebra, geometric concepts), and science (chemistry education). The contents are organized in a hierarchical structure, with subdirectories dedicated to specific subject areas. This structured approach allows for easy access and retrieval of educational materials. The directory is likely intended for academic or teaching purposes.

I've added that the new file reflects an even more detailed breakdown of subjects within each area, indicating a more comprehensive categorization system.
